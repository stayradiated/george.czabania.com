Sometimes adding a little delay to a user interface can improve the experience. A common example of this is debouncing the value from an input element.

## What is Debouncing?

The [MDN Glossary for `Debounce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Debounce) is a great place to start.

The key idea is that when you have a stream of rapidly firing events (such as keys being pressed while typing) - instead of reacting immediately to every single event - wait until there is a pause in the stream - i.e. the user hasn't typed anything for a little bit - and then react.

It's similar to using a [Throttle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Throttle) - but while a throttle will ensure a steady rate-limited stream, debouncing will wait until there is a pause in the events -- which usually indicates that the user has finished typing.

Think about how humans naturally talk with each other. When someone is mid-sentence, we don't interrupt after each word. Instead, we wait for that brief pause - that moment of silence that tells us they've completed their thought and it's our turn to respond.

## Why Debounce?

A key reason to use debouncing is to reduce UI lag. Processing every single keystroke may make interfaces feel sluggish, especially with CPU-intensive operations such as searching through tens of thousands of items or recalculating a report table.

Debouncing isn't always necessary: if the app can update quickly (i.e. within 16ms), then debouncing is unlikely to make much difference.

Another key reason is to reduce network traffic. Instead of making dozens of API requests with partial form data, we send a single request with the actual user query. This reduces network congestion and server load.

When we wait for the user to pause, we're acting on what they actually meant to type, not the half-formed thoughts along the way.

## Debouncing Inputs

When it comes to debouncing an `<input />` element, there are a few nice-to-have features for the user to make it feel more responsive (even when there is a high delay):

- If the user blurs the input, immediately trigger an update (i.e. they have tabbed out of it).
- If the user presses enter, immediately trigger an update (i.e. they want to submit their search query).
- Don't trigger in the middle of IME composition. I didn't know about this until recently, but composing complex characters (common in Japanese and Chinese) can take multiple keypresses, and the input shouldn't trigger an update until the composition is finished.

And some features that make for a good Svelte component:

- Two-way data binding: if you need to programmatically update the input value, you can - for example, clean the value of a search input.
- Resources are cleaned up when the component is unmounted: the `setTimeout` timer is cleared when we no longer need it, to avoid leaking memory.

## Example

I've put together a little example UI for searching a list of groceries. You can adjust the debounce delay and get a feel for how it works.

Notice that no delay _feels_ fast - but has the trade-off to make dozens of unnecessary API requests.

## Source Code

Here is the full source code for `DebouncedInput.svelte` (MIT Licensed).

I am intentionally not publishing it as a library - if you would like to use it, please copy/paste it.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
import { onDestroy, untrack } from "svelte";
import type { HTMLInputAttributes } from "svelte/elements";

type Props = HTMLInputAttributes & {
  // Debounce delay in milliseconds
  delayMs?: number;
};

let { delayMs = 250, value = $bindable(), ...restProps }: Props = $props();

if (delayMs < 0) {
  throw new Error("DebouncedInput: delayMs must be >= 0");
}

let inputValue = $state<Props["value"]>(value);
let timer = $state<ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | undefined>(undefined);
let isComposing = $state(false);

const schedule = () => {
  if (isComposing) {
    return;
  }
  if (timer) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
  }
  timer = setTimeout(flush, delayMs);
};

const flush = () => {
  if (timer) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = undefined;
  }
  value = inputValue;
};

const handleInput = () => {
  schedule();
};

const handleKeydown = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
  if (event.key === "Enter") {
    flush();
  }
};

const handleBlur = () => {
  flush();
};

const handleCompositionStart = () => {
  isComposing = true;
};

const handleCompositionEnd = () => {
  isComposing = false;
};

// If the parent manually updates the value, we need to update the input value
$effect(() => {
  if (value !== untrack(() => inputValue)) {
    inputValue = value;
  }
});

onDestroy(() => {
  if (timer) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
  }
});
</script>

<input
  bind:value={inputValue}
  oninput={handleInput}
  onkeydown={handleKeydown}
  onblur={handleBlur}
  oncompositionstart={handleCompositionStart}
  oncompositionend={handleCompositionEnd}
  {...restProps}
/>

## Usage

1. Use `<DebouncedInput />` just like a regular `<input />` element.
2. Bind the `value` prop to a `$state()` variable
3. (optional) Set a custom value for `delayMs` (defaults to 250ms)

Open this example [in the Svelte Playground](https://svelte.dev/playground/a1cb52c4018b4622ae8015e7b17f837e?version=latest).

```svelte
<script>
import DebouncedInput from "./DebouncedInput.svelte"

let value = $state('')
</script>

<DebouncedInput
  bind:value
  delayMs={300}
  type="text"
  placeholder="value"
/>

<pre><code>value = "{value}"</code></pre>
```
