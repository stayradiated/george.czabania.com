# Hello World

This is the first post on my new blog system that bridges Obsidian and Astro! 

## Features

- Write posts in Obsidian
- Publish with a simple front-matter flag
- Mobile-first authoring workflow
- Static site generation with Astro
- RSS feed support
- Tag-based organization

## How it works

1. Write in Obsidian on mobile
2. Use Working Copy to sync with GitHub
3. GitHub Actions builds and deploys automatically
4. Static site appears on GitHub Pages

This workflow enables completely friction-free blogging from an iPhone!
